\begin{abstract}
In order to retain the lead among its competitors, a software company needs to create a distributed system which is spanned across different geographical locations, vulnerable to sudden variations in demand and has remarkable Quality-of-Service requirements. Following current trends it chooses Cloud as a deployment platform. Unfortunately, existing cloud providers do not have tools and mechanisms that would enable dynamic load distribution among different data centers to meet aforementioned requirements.
In this article we want to outline the architecture of a self-adaptive platform (\emph{Cloud-SAP}) which facilitates scalable provisioning users' applications and fulfills QoS needs under variable conditions. Our solution can be considered a multi-layered environment for users' services as it applies the notion of an autonomic system to its every layer on a which auto scaling can be executed -- application, container, service and cloud. To ensure meeting QoS requirements at the cloud level we use the recent concept of a utility-oriented federation of cloud environments (InterCloud).
We present and compare current cloud solutions with the emphasis on their scaling capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate our preliminary results of conducted evaluation studies on the CloudSim toolkit.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Cloud computing, a relatively new concept which denotes offering computing utilities on demand in a pay-as-you-go manner like any other services available in today's society, has already started the process of transforming IT industry, making an impact on the way the software/hardware is produced and perceived. Because of its widespread presence in the IT community, this model makes computing resources more and more attractive for broader audience, especially in diverse branches of business, e.g. pharmaceutical or construction.

There are a few noticeable things which can be considered innovative in the way the services are provided. Firstly, clients of such services have no knowledge of the physical location of resources they use. Secondly, they are under illusions of infinite resources that are available. What is more, they pay providers only when they really use their services -- this means they do not need to invest heavily in building and maintaining hardware infrastructure. Last but not least, in order to ease dynamic resource management and manipulation, cloud providers use various virtualization technologies which operate on different levels, e.g. server, network or storage.

\subsection{Service Models}
Cloud computing classified the delivered services to three categories: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). They provide the consumer with infrastructure, deployment platform (application ecosystem) and software respectively. The just defined terms are commonly referred to in the Cloud community as \emph{service models}.

\subsection{Cloud federation -- InterCloud}
However hard cloud providers would try to fulfill even the most demanding requirements from their clients, it is virtually impossible that resources of one of them would be satisfactory for all users -- firstly, because their resources are finite; secondly, there are providers which specialize in providing services to only one, specific types of clients and which raised the quality of their resources to such a level that other cloud computing companies cannot compete with.
In particular, the last factor creates a need for a solution that would take into account different QoS expectations from the clients and map them onto the best resources offered by cloud providers. As it is impossible to predict the geographic distribution of consumers, the load coordination should be executed automatically and resources utilization should change in dependence of current load.

Such a model has been devised and named \emph{InterCloud}. In this solution resources are managed in a market-oriented fashion that enables dynamic regulation of the supply and demand of resources and promotes the mechanisms for their allocation that would take into account their priorities and levels of utilization.

\subsection{Application scaling}
Scalability is a widely accepted measure for improving application performance, consequently increasing offered Quality-of-Service. Despite the lack of a clear definition, in this article we consider this term an ability to work without delays and unproductive resource consumption at light, moderate, or heavy loads while making good use of available resources (in some works it is referred to as \emph{load scalability}).

Having clarified the term we use, the case of scalability can be reduced to a question: \emph{what kind of resources can we add, remove or change to improve application's performance.} However, it should be stressed that the first step towards effective performance of an application should be its proper tuning and configuration. Otherwise, no matter what kind of and how much resources is added it will not influence the overall application's utilisation.

Resources can be managed in two, common agreed-upon ways: \emph{vertical} and \emph{horizontal}. By \emph{vertical} we understand changing the number of nodes a system is comprised, such as servers in the context of a distributed application. \emph{Horizontal}, on the other hand, means changing the capacity of a single node in a system, e.g. adding additional memory, CPU, storage, etc.

\paragraph{Horizontal scaling (scaling out)} As it was stated in the previous paragraph, horizontal scaling refers to managing the number of instances the application runs on. Since provisioning a raw or subtracting an existing virtual machine is a common process which is performed by a hypervisor, the much more interesting one is the configuration of a node that would enable its cooperation among existing ones, e.g. the added instance should be used as a load balancer of the user's service.

\paragraph{Vertical scaling (scaling up)} Vertical scaling concentrates on managing the capacity of a single node. Among the most common resources that can be changed in runtime of a machine are (a) CPU, (b) memory and (c) storage.



\paragraph{Hypervisors} Being able to scale resources vertically requires hypervisors to have such possibilities. Table \ref{tab:hypervisors-resizing} presents resizing capabilities of common hypervisors.

\section{Who is Who in cloud provisioning}
In the context of this article, the main point of interest are providers which offer features related to resource management, monitoring and utilization. In general, current key providers include Amazon \emph{Web Services}, \emph{Microsoft Azure}, Google \emph{AppEngine} and \emph{Heroku}. Despite not all of them operate on the same level of abstraction, it is possible to compare them as they expose functionalities which can be classified as PaaS. For example, on top of its infrastructure services, Amazon has such products as \emph{Elastic Load Balancer}, \emph{Cloud Watch} and \emph{Auto Scaling} which, to some extent, matches our needs.

Table \ref{tab:cloud-providers-scaling} presents comparison of some Cloud providers with the emphasis on their scaling capabilities. Interestingly, all of them are focused solely on horizontal scaling, ignoring advantages offered by a fine-grained approach to scaling that leverage scaling up and application tuning.
