\begin{abstract}
In order to retain the lead among its competitors, a software company needs to create a distributed system which is spanned across different geographical locations, vulnerable to sudden variations in demand and has remarkable QoS requirements. Following current trends it chooses Cloud as a deployment platform. Unfortunately, existing cloud providers do not have tools and mechanisms that would enable dynamic load distribution among different data centers to meet aforementioned requirements.
In this article we want to outline the architecture of a self-adaptive platform which facilitates scalable provisioning users' applications and fulfills QoS needs under variable conditions. Our solution can be considered a multi-layered environment for users' services as it applies the notion of an autonomic system to its every layer on a which auto scaling can be executed -- application, container, service and cloud. To ensure meeting QoS requirements at the cloud level we use the recent concept of a utility-oriented federation of cloud environments (InterCloud).
We present and compare current cloud solutions with the emphasis on their scaling capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate our preliminary results of conducted evaluation studies on the CloudSim toolkit.
