# OVERVIEW

OpenNebulaApps is a suite of tools for users and administrators of OpenNebula
to simplify and optimize cloud application management and enable Platform as
a Service. OpenNebulaApps provides a service management layer on top of
OpenNebula by configuring the software stack in the applications, managing
multi-tiered applications, and building your own private market to distribute
applications across several OpenNebula instances.

## How Does OpenNebulaApps Complement OpenNebula?

OpenNebulaApps fills the gap between the service and the virtual infrastructure
layer. OpenNebulaApps works on top of OpenNebula at the service management
layer and leverages its contextualization framework and external
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) APIs to simplify and automate the
configuration, distribution and execution of cloud applications.

Thanks to OpenNebulaApps you can use an OpenNebula cloud as a platform for
running fully configured services to enable Platform as a Service (PaaS), in
addition to using it as a platform for running virtual infrastructure (IaaS).
Because Cloud applications consist of stacks of software components,
OpenNebulaApps contributes to significantly reduce the time needed to build,
distribute, and run new applications.

## Which Tools Are Available?

AppMarket builds a centralized catalog to share and distribute virtual
appliances across OpenNebula instances.

AppFlow enables the automatic execution of multi-tiered applications and their
management as a single entity.

AppStage performs the automatic installation and configuration of the software
stack that constitutes an application environment.

# INSTALLATION

Use the install scripts located in the directories flow, market and stage to
install the different components:

    # ( cd flow ; ./install.sh ) 
    # ( cd market ; ./install.sh ) 
    # ( cd stage ; ./install.sh )
