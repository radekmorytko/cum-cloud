\section{Requirements}
One can notice that elements that yields a solution for a problem stated in the first chapter, which is ensuring that users' application provide appropriate Quality-of-Service for its customers in a most-cost effective manner, were gradually introduced in previous chapters:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{scalability} - ability to improve application performance by enriching resources
	\item \emph{adaptivity} - ability to adapt (i.e. scale) appropriately to a current usage pattern
	\item \emph{inter-cloud awareness} - ability to compose an application deployment using different cloud providers; cooperation with different cloud provider to supply application with extra resources while performing application scaling
\end{itemize}

Next section states the general overview of the proposed solution, while the consecutive sections details its elements and finally the last section summarises the design choices in a context of system requirements.
